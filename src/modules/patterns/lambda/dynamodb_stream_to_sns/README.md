- Module contains handler for DynamoDB stream event.
- Handler sends batch message as is to SNS.
- Handler code served as zipped file.
- We do not zip file on-fly because of performance.
- Source code also duplicated in raw ("index.js") for version tracking reasons.
- Please do not forget to update zip file when handler sources code updated
